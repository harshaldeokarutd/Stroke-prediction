# Stroke-prediction
# Introduction
•According to World Health Organization, stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally which approximates to 11% of total deaths.​•In the US, stroke is the leading cause of long-term adult disability and fifth leading cause of death which approximates to 795,000 stroke event every year with about 75% of them being the first-time strokes.​•Study shows that strokes can be prevented 80% of the time, through proper education, on signs of the stroke. ​Hence, it’s critical that hospitals actively participate in Stroke prediction to eliminate treatment delays and improve outcomes for new and acute stroke patients.​

# Dataset
The dataset is obtained from Kaggle — Stroke Prediction. The dataset contains details about the patients like age, BMI, glucose level, gender, work type etc. The dataset has about 5110 observations with 249 patients with stroke occurrence. Hence we can infer from this that the data is highly imbalanced and the number of stroke occurrences account for only 4.87% of the total observations.
